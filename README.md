Benford's law, also called the Newcombâ€“Benford law, the law of anomalous numbers, or the first-digit law, is an observation about the frequency distribution of leading digits in many real-life sets of numerical data. The law states that in many naturally occurring collections of numbers, the leading digit is likely to be small. For example, in sets that obey the law, the number 1 appears as the leading significant digit about 30% of the time, while 9 appears as the leading significant digit less than 5% of the time. If the digits were distributed uniformly, they would each occur about 11.1% of the time. [source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law]

This repo will contain an algorithm to evaluate if a set of numerical data is in accordance with Benford's Law. The input must be a CSV (Comma separated values) file Iwth just one column.
